# CO2 Emissions Data Analysis

I created a Python programme that analyses CO2 emission data from 1997 to 2010 This programme prints data, provides brief of a given year, displays and compares Year vs. Emission graphs for chosen countries, and generates a separate data file for chosen countries. Matplotlib and CSV modules have been implemented. It was a self-paced project that Guru 99 provided.

Note: It's possible for the programme to end after the fourth question in repl platform. Kindly download and run the files from either GitHub or the repl. Ensure that your device has Python and Matplotlib installed.
