## CO2 Emissions Data Analysis

I created a Python programme that analyses CO2 emission data from 1997 to 2010. This programme prints data, provides brief of a given year, displays and compares Year vs. Emission graphs for chosen countries, and generates a separate data file for chosen countries. _Matplotlib_ and _CSV_ modules have been implemented. It was a self-paced project that Guru 99 provided.
